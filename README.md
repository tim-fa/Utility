# Utility
A collection of self-written (mostly C++) Code which I use in lots of my private projects.
This repo includes the following libs:
# InternalUtility
- Various helper functions and classes used for reverse engineering. This includes memory management, different function hooking methods, pointer handling for internal, injected dlls, for example for writing game hacks
- A simple renderer which can be used for rendering simple boxes and texts, unsed in Wallhacks but can be applied to different applications aswell.

# Log
- A console Logging class which produces nicely formatted and coloured log messages with addtitional information
- 
# Obfuscation
- Different methods for obfuscating variables in code so that simple memory manipulation e.g. via Cheat Engine can not be easily done#

# Maths
- Vector maths wrapper classes for different use cases
